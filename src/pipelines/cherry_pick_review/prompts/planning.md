Analyze the provided patch and determine which of the following review stages are relevant and should be executed:
- Stage 4: Resource management
- Stage 5: Locking and synchronization
- Stage 6: Security audit
- Stage 7: Hardware engineer's review

CRITICAL: Always err on the side of running more stages. If you are not absolutely sure, include the stage. If the patch is a trivial typo fix, you may omit some stages. Stages 1, 2, and 3 are always run and should not be included in your answer.

You MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object, no other text. Example:
```json
{"relevant_stages": [4, 5, 6, 7]}
